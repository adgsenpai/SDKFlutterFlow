# helloworld

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application using FlutterFlow.

You can create your GUI using FlutterFlow and then use the generated code to
build out your application.

Make sure you have your `void main` function set up correctly, and that you
have a `MaterialApp` widget as the root of your app.

Example in `main.dart` @ `/lib/main.dart`:

```
void main() => runApp(MaterialApp(
      home: foobarWidget(),
));
```

The `flutter_flow` code is given in the `lib` folder.

You may need to adjust your `SDK constraints` in `pubspec.yaml` to match the
version of Flutter you are using.

For now the default `pubspec.yaml` works. For the future, you may need to
adjust the `pubspec.yaml` file to match the version of Flutter you are using.
